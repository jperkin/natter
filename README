			natter - a ruby chat API.
			=========================
About:

	natter is a set of ruby APIs which make it easy for someone to write
	clients (and eventually servers) to interface with popular online chat
	systems.  It currently supports IRC (primarily RFC1459, but some
	RFC2812 support) and the NILEX style of talker systems.

Usage:

	examples/ircbot.rb and examples/talkerbot.rb show how easy it is to
	use, and how with a relatively small amount of code you can get a
	client up and running (although at the moment it probably won't be
	able to do much :-)

Install:

	% ruby install.rb config
	# ruby install.rb install

	useful or helpful in any way, then that's more than enough for me.  If
	you like it enough to buy me beer, then that is even better.  If you
	take the code, remove my header, and use it in a commercial project,
	then I'll be chuffed (and get less spam).  I get enough enjoyment out
	of coding this for myself - anything else is a bonus.  I don't believe
	the silly notion that someone can "steal" my code, unless of course
	they break in to my house and steal my NetBSD box...
